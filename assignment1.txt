1.Difference between http1 and http 2
http1.0:
status code:can define 16 status codes.
The error prompt is not specific enough.
Uses basic authentication scheme which is unsafe.
Provides support for caching via the if-modified since header.
For every TCP connection there is on;y one request and one response.

Http2:
Uses multiplexing,where over a single tcp connection resources to be delivered.
Underlying semantics of http such as header,status code remain the same.
upagrade in security measures.
caching is almost same as http1.
To reduce taffic in the page http 2 uses multiplexing and server push.
